            <blockquote cite="https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/tzu-the-texts-of-taoism-part-i">
                    <p>There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it;—for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed</p>
